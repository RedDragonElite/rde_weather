## 🎯 Overview

**RDE Weather & Time** solves the one thing every other weather script gets wrong — persistence. Server restarts, crashes, resource reloads — the world stays exactly how you left it. Storm stays storm. Night stays night. No more players logging back in to sudden sunshine after a restart.

Every player sees the exact same weather and time the instant they join. No desync, no drift, no vanilla randomness.

### Why RDE Weather & Time?

| Feature | Vanilla / Generic Scripts | RDE Weather & Time |
|---|---|---|
| Persists across restarts | ❌ | ✅ Saved to disk |
| Instant global sync on join | ❌ | ✅ |
| Smooth weather transitions | ❌ | ✅ Configurable fade |
| Blackout mode | ❌ | ✅ |
| Freeze time | ❌ | ✅ |
| Admin weather/time control | Limited | ✅ Full command set |
| Performance overhead | Variable | ✅ Near zero |
| Nostr logging support | ❌ | ✅ via rde_nostr_log |

## ✨ Features

### 🌦️ Weather System
- Full GTA V weather type support: `CLEAR`, `RAIN`, `THUNDER`, `SNOW`, `FOG`, `EXTRASUNNY`, and more
- Smooth transitions between weather states — configurable fade duration
- Weather state saved to disk — survives restarts and crashes
- Admin-forced weather changes broadcast instantly to all players

### 🕐 Time System
- Real-time clock with configurable cycle speed (default: 1 real second = 1 game minute)
- Time state persisted to disk — server restarts from exactly where it left off
- Freeze time toggle — lock the clock for events, screenshots, RP scenarios
- Quick preset commands for common times of day

### ⚡ Blackout Mode
- Toggle city power outage globally with a single command
- All players affected instantly — full immersion for events and RP

### 🔄 Synchronization
- Every joining player receives the current weather and time state immediately
- All state changes broadcast to all connected clients in real time
- No polling, no drift — event-driven architecture

---

## 📦 Dependencies

| Resource | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [ox_core](https://github.com/communityox/ox_core) | ✅ Required | Player/character framework |
| [rde_nostr_log](https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_nostr_log) | ⚠️ Optional | Decentralized weather change logging |

> **That's it.** No ox_lib, no oxmysql, no ox_target required. Pure and lightweight.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_weather.git
```

### 2. Add to `server.cfg`

```cfg
ensure ox_core
ensure rde_nostr_log   # optional
ensure rde_weather
```

### 3. Configure (Optional)

Edit `config.lua` to set your starting weather, cycle speed, and transition time.

### 4. Restart

```
restart rde_weather
```

The world syncs instantly on start. Check server console for confirmation.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

```lua
Config = {}

Config.DefaultWeather        = 'CLEAR'   -- starting weather on first boot
Config.WeatherTransitionTime = 30.0      -- seconds for smooth weather fade
Config.TimeCycleSpeed        = 1.0       -- 1 real second = 1 game minute
                                         -- increase for faster day/night cycles
Config.FreezeTime            = false     -- start with time frozen?
Config.Blackout              = false     -- start with city power off?
```

### Weather Types

Valid values for `Config.DefaultWeather` and the `/weather` command:

```
CLEAR · EXTRASUNNY · CLOUDS · OVERCAST · RAIN · CLEARING
THUNDER · SMOG · FOGGY · XMAS · SNOWLIGHT · BLIZZARD · SNOW · NEUTRAL
```

---

## 📋 Admin Commands

All commands require the `rde.weather.admin` ACE permission or an admin ox_core group.

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/weather` | `/weather [type]` | Force a specific weather type instantly |
| `/time` | `/time [hour] [minute]` | Set exact server time |
| `/freezetime` | `/freezetime` | Toggle time freeze on/off |
| `/morning` | `/morning` | Set time to 06:00 |
| `/noon` | `/noon` | Set time to 12:00 |
| `/evening` | `/evening` | Set time to 19:00 |
| `/night` | `/night` | Set time to 00:00 |
| `/blackout` | `/blackout` | Toggle city power outage |

### ACE Setup (server.cfg)

```cfg
add_ace group.admin rde.weather.admin allow
add_principal identifier.steam:110000xxxxxxxx group.admin
```

---

## 📡 Nostr Integration

If `rde_nostr_log` is running, weather and time changes are automatically logged to the Nostr network — decentralized, permanent, uncensorable server logs.

Watch weather changes from this system live on Nostr:
[Live Bot Feed](https://nostr.band/npub17he2teg8mxdjhlmnqtnw8s53068lc87dtcrrrm8yqaf6k425z07qkqw00z)

See [rde_nostr_log](https://github.com/RedDragonElite/rde_nostr_log) for setup.

## ⚡ Performance

- Event-driven — no per-tick polling
- State sync fires only on change, not on a loop
- No database dependency — state written to lightweight disk file
- Zero measurable overhead on large servers

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Weather not persisting after restart?**
Check that the resource has write permission to its own directory. The state file is written locally — some hosting panels restrict this. Check server console for file write errors on shutdown.

**Players joining with wrong weather/time?**
Ensure `rde_weather` starts **after** `ox_core` in `server.cfg`. The sync event fires on `ox:playerLoaded` — if ox_core isn't ready, the event is missed.

**Weather command not working?**
Verify your ACE permission setup. Run `test_ace [identifier] rde.weather.admin` in the server console to confirm the permission is granted.

**Blackout not affecting all players?**
Confirm no other weather/time resource is running simultaneously — conflicts between two weather scripts will cause desync. Disable or remove the other resource.
