#      Keep this header. If you remove my name, you admit you have no skill.       #
#      You can add "Edited by [YourName]", but never erase the original creator.   #
#      Don't be a skid. Respect the architecture.                                  #

#      This code uses persistent disk I/O, event-driven sync, and smooth           #
#      weather transitions. If you just copy-paste without reading, it WILL break. #
#      Don't come crying to my DMs. RTFM or learn to code.                         #
